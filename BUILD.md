# Devolution LLC Website

Enterprise Automation Consulting Website with optimized build pipeline.

## Development

### Setup
```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development
```bash
npm start
```

This will:
1. Run the build script to minify CSS and copy files to `dist/`
2. Start a development server at `http://localhost:3000`

### Build Only
```bash
npm run build
```

Generates optimized production assets in the `dist/` directory:
- Minifies `src/styles/main.css` → `dist/styles/main.min.css`
- Copies all static assets
- Updates HTML references to minified CSS

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the dev server without rebuilding. Use this if you've already run `npm run build`.

## Production

### GitHub Actions Pipeline

The `.github/workflows/deploy-website.yaml` workflow automatically:

1. **Triggers** on push to `master` branch
2. **Installs** Node.js dependencies
3. **Builds** production assets with CSS minification
4. **Deploys** to GitHub Pages (from `dist/` directory)

No manual steps needed — just commit and push to deploy!

## File Structure

```
src/
  ├── index.html         (references main.css)
  ├── styles/
  │   └── main.css       (source CSS, unminified)
  ├── scripts/
  │   ├── main.js
  │   ├── App.js
  │   └── components/
  └── public/
      └── (images, SVGs, etc.)

dist/                     (generated by build - do not commit)
  ├── index.html         (updated to reference main.min.css)
  ├── styles/
  │   ├── main.css
  │   └── main.min.css   (auto-generated)
  └── ...
```

## Performance Notes

- CSS is minified on every build (~50% reduction)
- Fonts load async to prevent render blocking
- Vue.js deferred until after first paint
- All source files stay readable in `src/`
- Only optimized `dist/` deployed to production

## Build Dependencies

- `csso-cli` - CSS minification (optional, falls back to simple minifier)

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails with "csso not found":**
- The build script has a fallback simple minifier, but for best results run `npm install` first

**Changes not reflected in dev server:**
- Run `npm run build` to regenerate the dist folder after making changes
